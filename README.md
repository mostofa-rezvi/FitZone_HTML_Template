## üé® Customization

Customizing the template is straightforward:

1.  **Content:** All content is in the `index.html` file. Simply open it and edit the text, links, and image paths to match your own.
2.  **Styling:**
    *   Open `css/style.css` to make changes.
    *   Key branding colors, fonts, and spacing are defined as CSS variables at the top of the file for quick and easy theme changes.
    ```css
    :root {
      --primary-color: #ff5733; /* Change this to your brand color */
      --secondary-color: #333;
      --font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    }
    ```
3.  **Images:** Replace the placeholder images in the `assets/images/` directory with your own.
4.  **JavaScript:** The `js/main.js` file contains the logic for the mobile menu, smooth scrolling, and other interactive features. You can modify or extend it as needed.
